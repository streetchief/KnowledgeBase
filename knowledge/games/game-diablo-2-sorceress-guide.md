# Sorceress Items and Runes

The Best Sorceress Items and Runewords in Diablo 2 Resurrected Patch 2.6

This guide will provide a tier ranking of all Runewords, Unique and other items for Helm, Shield, Weapon, Belt, Glove, Ring and Amulet slots. Ranks will be based on current usage among the S Tier Sorceress builds. Best in slot (BiS) will be provided for each signature Sorc build, including all elemental types and hybrid variants, including Energy Shield and dual elemental. Primary builds like Lightning, Fireball and Blizzard/Frozen Orb are the primary builds considered. Lower budget alternatives and niche item selections can be found lower in our tier lists. Our list will include items attainable to newer players, or for ladder resets. To build an optimum merc for your sorceress, follow our Best Merc Items Guide.
Best Helmet 

## helm

1.   Harlequin Crest Shako

+2 To All Skills
+ (1.5 Per Character Level) 1-148 To Life (Based On Character Level)
+ (1.5 Per Character Level) 1-148 To Mana (Based On Character Level)
Damage Reduced By 10%
50% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items
+2 To All Attributes

Shako is the most popular all around caster helmet, especially with PvM and Magic Finding in mind. It boasts a maximum +2 to all skills and strong ancillary stats like Life, Mana and Magic Find. Unlike class specific helmets (+ Skill to Sorc only), All Skills grant additional skill buffs to your battle orders for additional life/mana. This comes in at our top spot given the flexibility, general availability, usefulness and usage in PvM content. Consider socketing with an Um (resistances), Ist (Magic Find) or Cham (Cannot be Frozen) depending on your needs. Socketing with a Facet is also an option for additional damage, however Shako is not considered the ideal helmet to maximize pure damage for any Sorc variant.

2. Griffon’s Eye Diadem

+1 To All Skill Levels
+25% Faster Cast Rate
-15-20% To Enemy Lightning Resistance (varies)
+15-20% To Lightning Skill Damage (varies)
+100-200 Defense (varies)

The most powerful Lightning Sorc option for Helm (BiS), offering a significant boost directly increasing your lightning based damage, and decreasing enemy resistances. The additional 25FCR is the highest you can get in the helm slot, greatly aiding you to hit the 105 FCR breakpoint, or the 200FCR breakpoint. A Lightning facet is the standard jewel for the socket to further maximize lightning damage output.

3. Nightwing’s Veil

+2 To All Skill Levels
+8-15% To Cold Skill Damage (varies)
+90-120% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10-20 To Dexterity (varies)
+5-9 Cold Absorb (varies)
Half Freeze Duration
Requirements -50%

The best Cold Sorc damage optimizer (BiS), Nightwing’s offers +2 to all Skills, as well as direct boosts to your Cold Damage. Ancillary mods include, dexterity, and cold absorb (which should help mitigate the -negative resistances from a Cold Sunder charm. Notably, this helmet does not offer FCR, precluding the possibility of 200FCR when using this helm (without sacrificing other core gear)

4. Circlet, Coronet or Diadem (Rare or Magic)

Unfortunately with no Unique or runeword helms exist for the Fire Sorc equivalent to Griffon’s or Nightwing’s. Given this, Shako is a popular choice for PvM. However, if you’re opting to optimize damage output, a rare or magic coronet with some variation of these stats, would serve as the BiS option (with 1 or 2 Fire Facets socketed)

+2 to Sorc Skills or 3 to Fire/Lightning/Cold Skills
+20 FCR
+1 or 2 sockets
+Additional mods like stats, life, mana, resistances

This is our best helm option for Fire Sorcs who want to maximize damage and FCR.

5. Lore Runeword (Ort+Sol)

+1 To All Skills
+10 To Energy
+2 To Mana After Each Kill
Lightning Resist +30%
Damage Reduced By 7
+2 To Light Radius

Lore is an awesome ladder starter / low level runeword and one of the few items that provides all skills. The runeword base and runes can be easily acquired on normal difficulty.
Best Weapon

## Weapon

1.   Heart of the Oak (Mace/Staff base, Ko+Vex+Pul+Thul)

+3 To All Skills
+40% Faster Cast Rate
+75% Damage To Demons
+100 To Attack Rating Against Demons
Adds 3-14 Cold Damage, 3 sec. Duration
7% Mana Stolen Per Hit
+10 To Dexterity
Replenish Life +20
Increase Maximum Mana 15%
All Resistances +30-40
Level 4 Oak Sage (25 Charges)
Level 14 Raven (60 Charges)

HOTO is amongst the best sorceress weapons. While you have multiple Orb choices to boost your damage, none of them have defensive qualities such as HOTO’s huge boost for all resistances. If you want to have a sorc weapon which not only has great offensive qualities, but can improve your survivability as well, HOTO is an optimal choice. Oak sage charges are an added bonus.

2. Eschutas

+1-3 To Sorceress Skill Levels
+40% Faster Cast Rate
+10-20% To Fire Skill Damage
+10-20% To Lightning Skill Damage
+20-30 To Energy

The best damage option for Fire and Lightning variants, offering the same + skills (3 max) and FCR as HOTO with additional fire and light damage. The tradeoff are the stats, Replenish life and resistances which will detract from your survivability. The huge bonus to energy on Eschutas is often overlooked, but is very valuable for increased survivability for Energy Shield variants. 

3. Death's Fathom

+3 To Sorceress Skill Levels
+20% Faster Cast Rate
+15-30% To Cold Skill Damage
Lightning Resist +25-40%
Fire Resist +25-40%

The best damage option for Cold Variants. Boosting your cold damage considerably, as well as offering some FCR as well as Lightning and Fire resistances. With the combination of Death’s Fathom and Nightwing’s you will deal considerable damage but have less FCR available in Helm and Weapon slots than the Fire and Lightning Sorcs. This means the 200FCR breakpoint is unavailable to meta Cold Sorcs. 

4. Oculus Swirling Crystal 

+3 To Sorceress Skill Levels
+5 To Mana After Each Kill
All Resistances +20
25% Chance To Cast Level 1 Teleport When Struck
+30% Faster Cast Rate
+20 To Vitality
+20 To Energy
+20% Enhanced Defense
50% Better Chance Of Getting Magic Items

A fantastic all rounder, that is easier to find than the top 3 mentioned. When compared with HOTO, the raw stats do not compare favorably. However, the huge boost to MF offered by Occy makes this the best option for magic finding builds, regardless of skill tree choice. Given that this is the BiS item for the specialized purpose of farming items, the Ist rune is generally socketed to further optimize for that. 

5. Infinity (Polearm/Spear base, Ber+Mal+Ber+Ist)

50% Chance To Cast Level 20 Chain Lightning When You Kill An Enemy
Level 12 Conviction Aura When Equipped
+35% Faster Run/Walk
+255-325% Enhanced Damage
-(45-55)% To Enemy Lightning Resistance
40% Chance of Crushing Blow
Prevent Monster Heal
0.5-49.5 To Vitality (Based on Character Level)
30% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items
Level 21 Cyclone Armor (30 Charges)

Infinity is the best mercenary weapon when it comes to offensive qualities. While it deals a decent amount of damage, it also provides Conviction Aura which reduces monster resistances by 85%, and can often break monster immunities. While Infinity is usually considered a runeword for mercs (given it can only be made in 6 socket polearms), the Self-wielding Infinity is common among Lightning Sorcs, who wish to free up the Merc weapon slot while retaining Conviction Aura (Conviction is integral to successful Hell farming). This is usually built in a non-ethereal lower requirement polearm which enables you to use the Cyclone armor charges and repair them).  This build is mostly used on the Nova / Energy Shield variant with the Merc wielding Insight. Meditation Aura offering substantial survivability benefits for an ES Sorc. The lack of defensive stats from a Shield in this case is mitigated by the increased survivability from ES. 

6. Spirit (Sword base, Tal+Thul+Ort+Amn)

+2 To All Skills
+25-35% Faster Cast Rate
+55% Faster Hit Recovery
Adds 1-50 Lightning Damage
Adds 3-14 Cold Damage 3 Second Duration
+75 Poison Damage Over 5 Seconds
7% Life Stolen Per Hit
+250 Defense Vs. Missile
+22 To Vitality
+89-112 To Mana
+3-8 Magic Absorb

Spirit is the budget version of HOTO when used as a weapon, and is an awesome weapon for ladder starts or for lower level characters. It is adequate for the end game as well, and very few weapons provide more useful stats than a Spirit sword. The runes can easily be acquired at the end of Normal difficulty, and you can find a sword base in Normal Cow Level. A very low budget option that can be made early in your leveling phase. The stats are very good for a gap filler, and you receive a rarely seen weapon mod (FHR)

7. Insight (Staff/Polearm base, Ral+Tir+Tal+Sol)

Level 12-17 Meditation Aura When Equipped
+35% Faster Cast Rate
+200-260% Enhanced Damage
+9 To Minimum Damage
180-250% Bonus to Attack Rating
Adds 5-30 Fire Damage
+75 Poison Damage Over 5 Seconds
+1-6 To Critical Strike
+5 To All Attributes
+2 To Mana After Each Kill
23% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items

Insight is amongst the best mercenary runewords for a sorceress. Not only does it provide a huge amount of damage, it also grants Meditation Aura which takes care of your mana needs and makes the gameplay experience much quicker and smoother.

Special Mentions:
Call To Arms (Weapons, Amn + Ral + Mal + Ist + Ohm)
+1 To All Skills
+40% Increased Attack Speed
+250-290% Enhanced Damage (varies)
Adds 5-30 Fire Damage
7% Life Stolen Per Hit
+2-6 To Battle Command (varies)*
+1-6 To Battle Orders (varies)*
+1-4 To Battle Cry (varies)*
Prevent Monster Heal
Replenish Life +12
30% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items

CTA is the best switch weapon for all classes except for Barbarians. It provides you the Battle Orders and Battle Command skills, allowing you to gain +1 to all skills and a huge boost in life and mana as long as the two skills are casted on you. Sorceresses are quite fragile, and CTA makes a huge difference in survivability.

Leaf (Staff base, Tir+Ral)

Adds 5-30 Fire Damage
+3 To Fire Skills
+3 To Fire Bolt (Sorceress Only)
+3 To Inferno (Sorceress Only)
+3 To Warmth (Sorceress Only)
+2 To Mana After Each Kill
+ (2 Per Character Level) +2-198 To Defense (Based On Character Level)
Cold Resist +33%

Leaf is an amazing runeword for Fire Sorcs, and can be used by low level characters. The +3 to fire skills is unbeatable amongst low level items. However if you can acquire a Spirit Sword, you should choose it over Leaf.

Obsession (Staff base, Zod+Ist+Lem+Lum+Io+Nef)

Indestructible
24% Chance to cast level 10 Weaken when struck
+4 To All Skills
+65% Faster Cast Rate
+60% Faster Hit Recovery
Knockback
+10 To Vitality
+10 To Energy
Increase Maximum Life 15-25%
Regenerate Mana 15-30%
All Resistances +60-70
75% Extra Gold from Monsters
30% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items

Obsession is a newly introduced end-game runeword that's mainly useful for Sorceresses. It has both great offensive and defensive qualities, but a Spirit runeword shield and a decent sorc weapon will grant you better stats for any purpose. Still, if you manage to find a Zod and Ist rune, you can complete the runeword and grind with high efficiency.

Memory (Staff base, Lum+Io+Sol+Eth)

+3 to Sorceress Skill Levels
33% Faster Cast Rate
Increase Maximum Mana 20%
+3 Energy Shield (Sorceress Only)
+2 Static Field (Sorceress Only)
+10 To Energy
+10 To Vitality
+9 To Minimum Damage
-25% Target Defense
Magic Damage Reduced By 7
+50% Enhanced Defense

Memory’s main utility is its Energy Shield buff. As a Staff base can have +3 to energy shield, with a memory staff you can cast a +9 level energy shield before starting to farm (or PvP), boosting your survivability greatly.
Best Armor 

## Body Armor

1.   Chains of Honor (Body Armor base, Dol+Um+Ber+Ist)

+2 To All Skills
+200% Damage To Demons
+100% Damage To Undead
8% Life Stolen Per Hit
+70% Enhanced Defense
+20 To Strength
Replenish Life +7
All Resistances +65
Damage Reduced By 8%
25% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items

Chains of Honor is one of the best armors a sorceress can have. The +2 to All skills and +65% all resistance alongside other useful stats makes it one of the best, well-balanced armor for any sorceress. The strongest defensive option and considered by many as BiS. 

2. Enigma (Jah+Ith+Ber)

+2 To All Skills
+45% Faster Run/Walk
+1 To Teleport
+750-775 Defense (varies)
+ (0.75 Per Character Level) +0-74 To Strength (Based On Character Level)
Increase Maximum Life 5%
Damage Reduced By 8%
+14 Life After Each Kill
15% Damage Taken Goes To Mana
+ (1 Per Character Level) +1-99% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (Based On Character Level)

Enigma can be overlooked on Sorceress due to her inherent teleport ability nullifying the need for Enigma’s teleport. However, the raw stats of Enigma are top tier, and the BiS for magic finding purposes. The additional strength can assist greatly with equipping higher strength gear like Monarch shield bases. You can also save additional skills on Teleport and its prerequisites making this a competitive choice for BiS along with Chains of Honor.

3. Skin of the Vipermagi 

+1 To All Skill Levels
+30% Faster Cast Rate
+120% Enhanced Defense
All Resistances +20-35 (varies)
Magic Damage Reduced by 9-13 (varies)

A great well rounded and attainable option, offering you +1 skills, highest FCR for the armor slot, resistances, and an additional socket slot. The Magic absorb can come in handy. This item is usually chosen to push FCR breakpoint thresholds with certain setups (i.e. Self-wielding Infinity Sorcs). 

4. Ormus Robes

+10-20 Defense
+20% Faster Cast Rate
+10-15% To Cold Skill Damage
+10-15% To Fire Skill Damage
+10-15% To Lightning Skill Damage
+3 bonus to a random Sorceress skill (Sorceress Only)
Regenerate Mana 10-15%

Ormus provides our highest DPS option, offering direct boosts to elemental damage, as well as a handy 20FCR. The additional +3 to a random Sorc skill can further buffer your damage or survivability (usually players opt to find one that has +3 to their primary damage spell, i.e. Blizzard, Lightning, Fireball). Prices of Ormus Robes’ vary depending on the mods rolled. A perfect Ormus with + 3 to one of the three primary damage spells can be very expensive. Try to find the highest % you can for the elemental tree you will use.  

5. Stealth (Body Armor base, Tal + Eth)

Magic Damage Reduced By 3
+6 To Dexterity
+15 To Maximum Stamina
Poison Resist +30%
Regenerate Mana 15%
25% Faster Run/Walk
25% Faster Cast Rate
25% Faster Hit Recovery

Stealth is a great leveling runeword as it boosts run speed and casting speed, allowing you a quicker leveling experience.

6. Enlightenment (Body Armor base, Pul+Ral+Sol)

5% Chance To Cast Level 15 Blaze When Struck
5% Chance To Cast level 15 Fire Ball On Striking
+2 To Sorceress Skill Levels
+1 To Warmth
+30% Enhanced Defense
Fire Resist +30%
Damage Reduced By 7

Enlightenment is a useful sorceress armor for it’s +2 to sorc skills and fire resistances. It does require some mid runes. It is likely you find a more useful Unique placeholder like Vipermagi, but this can be considered. 

7. Smoke (Body Armor base, Nef + Lum)

+75% Enhanced Defense
+280 Defense Vs. Missile
All Resistances +50
20% Faster Hit Recovery
Level 6 Weaken (18 Charges)
+10 To Energy
-1 To Light Radius

Smoke is also a decent levelling runeword, but mainly for its defensive qualities. If you play hardcore, the +50 all resistance definitely is worth the investment.
Best Shield

## Shield

1.   Spirit (Shield base, Tal+Thul+Ort+Amn)

+2 To All Skills
+25-35% Faster Cast Rate
+55% Faster Hit Recovery
+250 Defense Vs. Missile
+22 To Vitality
+89-112 To Mana
Cold Resist +35%
Lightning Resist +35%
Poison Resist +35%
+3-8 Magic Absorb
Attacker Takes Damage of 14

Spirit is by far the best shield a sorceress can wear in the endgame. It has unmatched qualities such as the 2 all skills, the 55% FHR, the + resistances, mana and vitality. An Orb+Spirit combo is usually the best a sorceress can have at high levels.

2. Stormshield

Indestructible
+35% Faster Block Rate
25% Increased chance of blocking
+371 Defense (Based On Character Level)
+30 To Strength
Cold Resist +60%
Lightning Resist +25%
Damage Reduced by 35%
Attacker Takes Lightning Damage of 10

Stormshield is the strongest physical damage reduction shield and is the most popular choice in Hardcore, in conjunction with a max block build. It provides an unrivaled 35% to DR, high defense and some resistances, making you much more durable.

3. Lidless Wall

+1 To All Skill Levels
+20% Faster Cast Rate
+80-130% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10 To Energy
Increase Maximum Mana 10%
+3-5 To Mana After Each Kill (varies)
1 To Light Radius

A great and budget option providing great caster stats. While not packing the punch of Spirit Monarch in terms of raw output, Lidless requires significantly less strength investment which should be accounted for in your comparisons.

4. Gerke’s Sanctuary

30% Increased chance of blocking
+180-240% Enhanced Defense (varies)
Replenish Life +15
All Resistances +20-30 (varies)
Damage Reduced by 11-16 (varies)
Magic Damage Reduced by 14-18 (varies)

An interest shield choice used primarily by Immortal Sorcs. This Shield offers resistances, but it is used for its replenish life, physical and magic absorb which when combined with an optimized Energy Shield and other synergistic gear, will make you (as the name suggests), nearly immortal.  

5. Sanctuary Runeword (Shield+Ko+Ko+Mal)

+20% Faster Hit Recovery
+20% Faster Block Rate
20% Increased Chance of Blocking
+130-160% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+250 Defense vs. Missile
+20 To Dexterity
All Resistances +50-70 (varies)
Magic Damage Reduced By 7
Level 12 Slow Missiles (60 Charges)

Sanctuary offers a sound defensive Shield, particularly against ranged and elemental damage. Its relatively low rune cost makes it an easily affordable mid tier shield and a great option for Hardcore.

6. Jeweler's Monarch of Deflecting (Magic)

30% Faster Block Rate
20% Increased Chance of Blocking
Socketed [4]

JMOD’s are used to allow you to reach maxblock while giving you the maximum amount of sockets available in a shield for Facets. This shield choice is for those looking to optimize pure damage output at the cost of speed, defensive stats and other mods.

7. Rhyme (Shield base, Shael+Eth)

20% Increased Chance of Blocking
40% Faster Block Rate
+25 to All Resistances
Regenerate Mana 15%
Cannot Be Frozen

## Gloves

1.   Magefist

+1 To Fire Skills
+20% Faster Cast Rate
Adds 1-6 Fire Damage
+20-30% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10 Defense
Regenerate Mana 25%

One of two options for 20FCR at this slot, with the additional benefit of +1 to Fire skills and mana regeneration, both helpful to a Sorceress (more or less depending on the variant you have chosen). Certainly BiS for Fire Sorcs. 

2. Trang Oul’s Claw

+20% Faster Cast Rate
Cold Resist +30%
+30 Defense
+25% Poison Skill Damage
+2 To Curses (Necromancer Only)

Our Second option offering 20FCR. This would be the best option for Cold Sorcs wanting to negate some of the negative cold resistances from a Sunder Charm, and who do not benefit from the + to Fire Skills.

3.           Chance Guard

+25 To Attack Rating
+20-30% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+15 Defense
200% Extra Gold From Monsters
25-40% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (varies)
2 To Light Radius

Chancies still hold the BiS MF gloves spot, given the incomparable bonus to MF for gloves (while lacking FCR or any other useful mod for a Sorc)

4. Frostburn

+5% Enhanced Damage
Adds 1-6 Cold Damage
+10-20% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+30 Defense
Increase Maximum Mana 40%

A unique option granting huge boosts to your mana pools. For an ES Sorc whose mana pool functions as a life pool, these gloves will grant significant boosts to your overall survivability, particularly when paired with an insight merc for high mana regeneration.

5. Bloodfist

10% Increased Attack Speed
+30% Faster Hit Recovery
+5 To Minimum Damage
+10-20% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10 Defense
+40 To Life

A non-standard defensive option for Vita Sorcs. FHR, and Life provide a helpful defensive boost, and the easy attainability of this item makes it ideal for early leveling. 

## Belt

1.   Arachnid’s Mesh

+1 To All Skill Levels
+20% Faster Cast Rate
Slows Target by 10%
+90-120% Enhanced Defense (varies)
Increase Maximum Mana 5%
Level 3 Venom (11/11)

The BiS Caster Belt in the game. This is the only belt that offers + skills as well as 20FCR, making this a no-brainer for speed and damage optimization. 

2. Goldwrap

10% Increased Attack Speed
+40-60% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+25 Defense
50-80% Extra Gold From Monsters (varies)
30% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items
2 To Light Radius

Much like Chance Guards, this offers minimal utility but can be considered the best MF belt given the huge boost to the one attribute. This is also benefited by how easy it is to find this belt, making this a fantastic early-mid and late option for MF builds.

3. Snowclash

5% Chance To Cast Level 7-20 Blizzard When Struck (varies)
Adds 13-21 Cold Damage
+2 To Chilling Armor (Soreceress Only)
+2 To Blizzard (Soreceress Only)
+3 To Glacial Spike (Soreceress Only)
+130-170% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+15% To Maximum Cold Resist
+15 Cold Absorb

Snowclash is a very strong option for Blizzard or Cold variants who will benefit greatly from the cold absorb and increased max resistances for Cold (provided you can meet the new resistance cap). The bonus to individual cold skills provides additional damage while + to Chilling armor allows you to invest no skills in cold armors.

4. Thundergod’s Vigor

5% Chance To Cast Level 7 Fist Of Heavens When Struck
Adds 1-50 Lightning Damage
+3 To Lightning Fury (Amazon Only)
+3 To Lightning Strike (Amazon Only)
+160-200% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+20 To Strength
+20 To Vitality
+10% To Maximum Lightning Resist
+20 Lightning Absorb

A unique option if additional lightning defense is required. Like Snowclash, it provides additional max resistances and lightning absorb. However, Sorcs do not benefit from the + to individual lightning skills given they’re targeted at the Javazon making this a less favorable option. The additional stat buffs to strength and vitality are useful. 

5. Verdungo’s Hearty Cord

+10% Faster Hit Recovery
+90-140% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+30-40 To Vitality (varies)
Replenish Life +10-13 (varies)
+100-120 Maximum Stamina (varies)
Damage Reduced by 10-15% (varies)

A defensive option offering physical damage reduction and vitality. An unusual choice for a Sorc but it can be considered if you come across one. While physical damage reduction can be helpful, you should be at a range where most physical attackers can’t reach you. 

 
## Boots

1.   Rare or Crafted Boots

The best all round boot  which may require some searching and usually have some combination of, FRW, FHR, Resistances (can roll 3 types up to 40), strength, dexterity, magic find, or replenish life. These will provide the best possible survivability stats for your Sorc.

2. War Travelers

25% Faster Run/Walk
Adds 15-25 Damage
+150-190% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10 To Strength
+10 To Vitality
40% Slower Stamina Drain
Attacker Takes Damage of 5-10 (varies)
30-50% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (varies)
The specialized choice and BiS for MF sorcs who want up to an additional 50% MF. The additional stats are helpful bonuses. 

3. Aldur's Boots

Indestructible
40% Faster Run/Walk
+180 Maximum Stamina
10% Damage Taken Goes To Mana
Heal Stamina Plus +32%
+50 To Life
Fire Resist +40-50% (varies)

The fastest boot boasting 40FRW. The big boost to fire resistances are particularly helpful to Sunder wielding fire Sorcs. This set item is relatively easy to find and should be one of the cheaper alternatives.

4. Sandstorm Trek

20% Faster Run/Walk
+20% Faster Hit Recovery
+140-170% Enhanced Defense (varies)
+10-15 To Strength (varies)
+10-15 To Vitality (varies)
+99 Maximum Stamina (Based On Character Level)
50% Slower Stamina Drain
Poison Resist +40-70% (varies)
Repairs 1 Durability in 20 Seconds

A fantastic all rounder for all classes offering FRW, FHR, strength, vitality and significant poison resistances. An ethereal version is preferred given the inherent self-repair mod found on the boot, but this makes negligible difference to its performance while raising the price tag substantially.

5. Silkweave

30% Faster Run/Walk
+200 Defense vs. Missile
+150-190% Enhanced Defense (varies)
Increase Maximum Mana 10%
+5 To Mana After Each Kill

A strong option for all ES variants given the increase to your mana pool and additional replenish after kills. Crafted mana boots have higher ceilings in terms of output, but are difficult to obtain.
Best Amulet 

## Amulet

1. Maras Kaleidoscope

+2 To All Skill Levels
+5 To All Attributes
All Resistances +20-30 (varies)

We have limited top tier options for Sorc circs given the prevalence of Maras and its status as the best all round caster amulet. With 2 to all skills and up to 30 to all resistances, this amulet is hard to beat unless you can find a superior rare or crafted.

2. Rare or Crafted Sorc Amulet

A more expensive and harder to source option, Sorc rare amulets can spawn with +2 sorc skills, 10FCR and a plethora of additional helpful mods including resistances and stats. Crafted amulets have a higher FCR ceiling at 20, and are necessary in some builds to reach the 200fcr breakpoint (without sacrificing key items in the build). 

 
## Rings

1.   Stone of Jordan

+1 To All Skill Levels
Adds 1-12 Lightning Damage
+20 To Mana
Increase Maximum Mana 25%

One of two rings that grant + to all skills as well as a generous boost to your mana pool. The most commonly used Sorc ring and BiS for energy Sorc variants, or if you’re suffering from mana issues. 

2. Bul Kathos Wedding Band

+1 To All Skill Levels
3-5% Life Stolen Per Hit (varies)
+49 To Life (Based On Character Level)
+50 Maximum Stamina

Second ring that grants + to all skills and some additional life. This is optimal where additional mana is not required (usually when running an Insight merc, when Conviction from Infinity is not required, i.e. Cold Sorcs who have enough - enemy negative resistances to break immunities with Sunder and Cold Mastery.

3. Rare Ring

If you’re in need of additional FCR for a breakpoint, the ring slot can provide 10FCR as well as useful mods like stats, life, mana, resistances and MF at the cost of a skill point. 

4. Ravenfrost / Dwarf star / Wisp Projector 

These rings rank equally and function as buffers to your elemental defenses providing a single elemental absorb. Ravenfrost additionally grants cannot be frozen (note: FCR is unaffected by freeze so this is not a huge factor). Wisp will protect you from souls and grant you useful Oak Sage charges, Dwarf Stars are useful for Travincal farming, and Ravenfrosts can be helpful in some A5 areas, particularly in the Crystalline Passage and Frozen River. 

 
Conclusion

This guide should provide you some fantastic options to gear up your Sorc no matter the purpose. Remember to account for breakpoint considerations, and look for good gear combinations which enables you to optimize your particular build. If you are tired of farming for endless hours, you can quickly buy the best items at our D2R Store.
