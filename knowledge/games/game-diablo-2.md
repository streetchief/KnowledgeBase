Spirit is the budget version of HOTO, and is an awesome weapon for ladder starts or lower level characters. It is adequate for the end game as well, and very few weapons provide more useful stats than a Spirit sword. The runes can easily be acquired at the end of Normal difficulty, and you can find a sword base in Normal Cow's Level.
