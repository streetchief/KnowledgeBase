# Object Oriented Programming

## Object Oriented Design (OOD)

1. Handle ambiguity - who what where when why and how
2. Define the core Objects - core objects
3. Analyze relationships - inherit? one-to-one? one-to-many?
4. Investigate actions - i.e. methods and parameters

## OOD Patterns

- Singleton - only one instance
- Factory - returns instances
