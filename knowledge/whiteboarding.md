## Strategies

### REACTO

- Repeat: state the problem to check comprehension
- Examples: consider possible use and edge cases
- Approach: state strategy for accomplishing goal
- Code: implement strategy in a written program
- Test: check that example cases pass correctly
- Optimize: discuss ways of improving performance

### CtCI

- Listen
- Examples
- Brute Force
- Optimize (algo) with B.U.D. - Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, Duplicated work
- Walkthrough (algo)
- Implement
- Test

#### Need a Hint?

- Look for unused info
- Fresh example
- Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR) - given a _problem_ what is the best outcome possible?

#### Optimizations to Consider

- Trade space for time, or possibly vice versa
- Pre-compute info i.e. sort
- Use a hash table/cache
- Consider Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR)

#### Optimization Techniques

- B.U.D. - Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, Duplicated work
- DIY - Use real example and try it
- Simplify and generalize
- Base case and Build (great for recursion)
- Data Structure brainstorm
