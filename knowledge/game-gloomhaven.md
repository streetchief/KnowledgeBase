### Cards

#### Battlefield Medicine (lvl 1)

A lost card to give out 4 more healing than a regular Medical Pack is not worth it.  The bottom of this card sounds attractive but does not 'cure' poison or wound but only prevents their effects this round.  We always have something better to do than using this card.

#### First Aid (lvl 1)

The top of this card gives you xp and gives an ally a Med Pack.  The bottom gives you an above average move with great initiative.  This will be a great card for you until you replace it at high level play.  Remember that giving a Medical Pack is always a better long term plan than a straight heal.  They both cost the same amount of turns for you but provide your ally with an extra card to make use of as they see fit.

#### Bloody Saw (lvl 1)

Above average damage with 3 damage dirrectly and a 4th pretty much guaranteed when the monster takes its first wound.  Also gives xp!  Having a loot card can be good in the right situation but bottom loots are rarely that helpful.  Does not really matter though because the top is worth playing every time you cycle your cards.

#### Hold Back the Pain (lvl 1)

This card will stay in your deck to the very end.  The heal 3 gain xp on top is totally fine and you may use it for this effect occasionally.  More often you will want to use the bottom of this card.  Your above average attacks can now hit multiple monsters and apply conditions at the same time.  Bloody Saw combined with this card will produce a huge amount of damage.  The only downside is that you must be in position already when you use this combo because you will not have movement.  SB can handle that problem with clever use of other cards.

#### Triage (lvl 1)

The top of this card is not worthwhile.  A lost card for heal 8 over 4 turns at melee range is not very good.  The bottom of this card is an above average move but is attached to a middle initiative card and SB has good movement without this card.  At low levels you will keep this card just for the movement but will quickly replace it once you have better movement cards.

#### Prevention is Key (lvl 1)

The top of this card will stay in your deck for a long time.  You will want to play this card with a late move card so that you can move into the middle of a number of monsters late in the round after they have already attacked.  Apply the disarm so that you will be safe from attack next round.  This is the perfect opener for your "Bloody Saw" / "Hold back the Pain" combo next round.  The bottom of this card is also fine and it gives you free xp when you don't need the top.

#### Curative Mixture (lvl 1)

This card will stay with you throughout because of the perk associated with the heal.  This card has great synergy with some of your own cards that will cause you to be immobilized.  Use this as the follow up and heal yourself, get xp and free yourself of that self inflicted immobilize to move out of danger.

#### Booster Shot (lvl 1)

Heal 4 is above average but gives you no xp.  The bottom of this card is fantastic when given to a character that is going to tank hits... however, loosing a card right at the start of the scenario to make someone else better is really going to cramp your ability to dish out damage over the course of the scenario.  While the card has great functionality, it is not a fun card for you.  Keep it at low level just for the heal but we will remove it soon enough.

#### Hand of the Surgeon (lvl 1)

While 4 is above average for damage, "Bloody Saw" does the same amount of damage baseline with the potential for more through their wound.  The bottom of this card sounds amazing but means you are not moving this turn.  Your allies would be required to move to you in order to get a heal.  Take this card at low levels but aim to replace it with better attacks as you level up.

#### Syringe (lvl 1)

The top of the card can prevent a lot of damage if you have a tank who is prepared to take a number of hits this round.  The bottom of this card is great if you do not need to move this round.  Stun is the best crowd control in the game and applying poison is all the better.

#### Teamwork (lvl x)

The top of this card is a stamina boost for your allies but is a lost card and you may as well just give out Medical Packs which accomplish almost the same thing without loosing stamina yourself.  The bottom of this card is extremely situational as it allows your team to potentially move further on a big scenario... but, they have to all be next to you for this to work.  Leave this card out.

#### Vaccine (lvl x)

The top of this card is tempting because it is the only ranged attack SB has access to until very late level.  It also applies poison and gives xp.  The bottom of this card could be useful in specific scenarios where you will encounter a great deal of poison but is generally not worth taking as you are sacrificing your stamina to help someone else have more fun.  Overall, I would leave this card out as you have much better attacks to make than this one.

#### Mobile Response (lvl x)

A double loss card with a move 5 that you have access to without being a loss as well as a response to poison or other conditions that does not work on yourself and means loosing the card for the same effect that Curative Mixture gives us without a loss.  Leave this card out.

#### Hamstring (lvl 2)

Hamstring gives you a much needed attack card as well as one of the best move cards in the game.  The immobilize is not a problem for you as you either end up somewhere that you want to stand for next turn (doing your attack combo?) or you can use the top of Curative Mixture to remove the immobilize from yourself and move even further the next turn.  Mobility is key for SB because everything SB does is Range 1.  I found myself using the movement on this card more often than the attack as I leveled up.  Take this card.

#### Precaution (lvl 2)

The top of Precaution is one of the few cards that SB gets that does not require you to be adjacent to the ally you plan on helping.  That said, shield is generally only helpful for one ally at a time (the one who will be hit this round) and a small shield is generally only helpful while the scenarios remain low difficulty.  More likely you would use this card for the bottom but we once again run into a bottom action that requires you to be next to an ally.  This puts pretty difficult conditions on this card and you will get better Medical Pack cards latter.  Forget Precaution.

#### Regenerative Tissue (lvl 3)

Regenerative Tissue is not a very good card.  The top is only 2 heal more than your other basic heals and has the condition of it being used on yourself.  You could of course use this with Hand of the Surgeon but again, to get value, your team must be next to you when you use this card.  The effort to make that work is better spent doing other things.  The bottom sounds really cool but SB does not want to sacrifice his stamina to allow someone else to enjoy the game more than you.  Don't take this card.

#### Vital Strike (lvl 3)

Vital Strike is a great card for SB.  The top attack 7 is fantastic with Hold Back The Pain.  You can often move into the middle of a group of monsters and one shot most of them with this card.  While you are waiting for the right moment, the bottom of this card is also an above average move.  Take this card and don't look back.

#### Blood Transfusion (lvl 4)

The top of Blood Transfusion is a bit of a joke.  You are effectively doing a heal 5 because your health is just as much a resource as your allies health.  Heal 5 is only slightly better than your other heal cards and it cannot be used on yourself.  The bottom attack could be welcome but again, the heal 2 is basically useless as the requirements of having your allies next to you without you moving will make the heal rarely useful.  This card might be considered useful for SB if it did not compete with a much better card.

#### Do no Harm (lvl 5)

Do no Harm is one of the best cards for SB and will be the card you take regardless of what build you go with.  The top is an execute that can make scenarios much easier if you are faced with a difficult elite monster and at the very least gives you 2 xp at the end of the scenario.  The downside is not that big of a deal for you (Curative Mixture next turn lets you move again).  In the mean time, the bottom of this card is an above average move with an average heal attached for free.  This card allows you to move to an ally and heal them with a bottom action and then heal with a top action in the same turn.  Alternately, the late initiative on this card makes it an excellent opener to combine with Prevention is Key and then your Hold back the Pain combo next turn.  With the addition of this card into your deck you are becoming one of the most mobile characters in the game.  Take this card.

#### Research the Cure (lvl 5)

This will be a controversial statement, but I do not recommend you take Research the Cure.  It is controversial because the bottom of the card is amazing.  Permanent shield 1 plus immunity to negative effects is an insane buff to one of your allies.  The problem is that you are once again being asked to sacrifice your own stamina and fun for the sake of making an ally able to get away with silly moves.  The top of the card is irrelevant as you would always play the bottom of the card on turn one anyway.  Remember, you can play Gloomhaven without a support character in your party at all.  No one NEEDS you to take this card for the sake of the team.  You are already going to be helping out a lot with the needs of your allies.  Blanket sacrificing a card at the start of the scenario is not something I'm interested in doing.

#### Amputate (lvl 5)

Amputate on the other hand is a great card.  The top is a straight upgrade to Bloody Saw with an extra damage as well as immobilize.  If you still need the attacks, you might keep both Amputate and Bloody Saw but this will eventually replace Bloody Saw all together.  The bottom seems to be a troll card but I did use it surprisingly often.  If you are in a lull between rooms and you plan on long resting next turn anyways, why not turn that heal 2 from the rest into a heal 9.  Stun doesn't matter to you if you plan on long resting anyway.  Take this card and try not to let your party see the other card you could have taken.

#### Euthanize (lvl 6)

Level 6 will be another controversial choice.  I do not believe that Euthanize typically is worth taking.  While non loss executes are typically very powerful, this one has too many requirements to make it worthwhile.  The primary way that you will apply two negative conditions to an enemy is to walk up and attack them.  Once you've done that, you will have already done half of their health.  Next turn you can execute them... but why not just attack them again for the same effect?  Remember, this only works on Normal Enemies who have less health than their elite counterparts.  There are rare circumstances when facing particularly high health enemies where this card would be useful but there will be far more scenarios where you will be using this card just for the bottom and you already have a card that does basically the same thing.  I have played a lot of scenarios with SB and at high difficulty level and have rarely found instances where this card would have been better than just doing another attack.

#### Prescription (lvl 6)

Prescription is finally a true upgrade for our Medical Pack arsenal.  A straight upgrade to First Aid (assuming you have 2 allies), this card will be a boon of Xp, healing and stamina to your team.  The bottom doesn't matter because you will always use this card for its top.  I have found that your allies will love you if you use this card on turn one when you are all grouped up as it gives them the ability to heal themselves at any point in the future and gives them an extra card in their hand.  This card also has great synergy with your level 7 card that you will take.  Take this card.
