# Job Search

## Project Descriptions

One activity to consider is write up project descriptions.  
See the [template](../assets/project-notes-template.md) to get an idea of what it contains.  
Filling this template out can help you identify and articulate your experiences.  
This in turn helps during interviews when talking about your history.
