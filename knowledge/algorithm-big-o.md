# Big O

- ways of counting an algorithm
- language for talking about functions

## Bounds

- big o vs big omega vs big theta
- bounds are only valid greater than some initial value n0 (kind of like a steady-state signal)
- O (n) is actually the upper bound on f
- Omega (n) is the lower bound
- Theta (n) is upper and lower bounded - this is the one we use, but we drop the middle cross of theta
- upper bound is not worst case

## Recursive functions

- for recursive functions with multiple calls, often runtime is O(branches^depth)
