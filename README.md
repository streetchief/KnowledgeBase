# KnowledgeBase

A collection of useful resources FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
The idea of these documents are to be sort of a graph database, each file is a node representing a topic or idea.
Files are roughly named, with optional topic prefixes, e.g. `language`, or `interview`.

We should adopt a sort of [Reverse DNS notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation), going from the general to the specific, i.e. `general-more-specific-most-specific`; e.g. `os-windows-applications`.

## Graph Knowledge Base

A.k.a. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

Possibly using:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -  a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
- [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - Treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from.
- [Digital Gardening in Obsidian](https://bytes.zone/posts/digital-gardening-in-obsidian/)

Alternatives:

- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - A note-taking tool for networked thought.
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) - very new; vscode plugin only.
