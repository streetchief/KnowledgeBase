# KnowledgeBase

A collection of useful resources for software engineers, and others.  
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  
The idea of these documents are to be sort of a graph database, each file is a node representing a topic or idea.  
Files are roughly named, with optional topic prefixes, e.g. `language`, or `interview`.

We adopt a sort of [Reverse DNS notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation), going from the general to the specific, i.e. `general-more-most-specific`; e.g. `os-windows-applications`.

Currently hosted at [github.com/streetchief/KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/streetchief/KnowledgeBase).

## How to Use

Either browse the online repository, or for easier browsing, clone the repository locally and browse with your favorite editor.  
There is a ton of useful information in [the knowledge folder](./knowledge/).  
We also have:

- copies of 3rd parties resources mapped to Markdown, like [`power-verbs.md`](./assets/power-verbs.md) in [the assets folder](./assets/)
- scripts like [`generate-journal-page.sh`](./tools/generate-journal-page.sh) in [the tools folder](./tools/)
- file templates like [`generic-node-script.mjs`](./templates/generic-node-script.mjs) in [the templates folder](./templates/)
- documentation for contributors like [`how-to-use-licensing-info.md`](./docs/how-to-use-licensing-info.md) in [the docs folder](./docs/)

Tip: when browsing `github{dot}com`, press the `t` key to bring up a fuzzy file search.

## Graph Knowledge Base

A.k.a. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

Possibly using:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -  a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
- [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - Treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from.
- [Digital Gardening in Obsidian](https://bytes.zone/posts/digital-gardening-in-obsidian/)

Alternatives:

- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - A note-taking tool for networked thought.
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) - very new; vscode plugin only.
