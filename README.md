# KnowledgeBase

A collection of useful resources FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
The idea of these documents are to be sort of a graph database, each file is a node representing a topic or idea. 

## Graph Knowledge Base

A.k.a. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

Possibly using:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -  a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
- [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - Treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from.
- [Digital Gardening in Obsidian](https://bytes.zone/posts/digital-gardening-in-obsidian/)

Alternatives:

- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - A note-taking tool for networked thought.
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) - very new, vscode plugin only.
